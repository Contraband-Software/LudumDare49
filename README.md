# Soviet Office Simulator

### AKA "actually-actually-actually-ld49"
 
Our entry for Ludum Dare 49.

Made in Unity 2020.3.18f1 with HDRP

Made by [@JakubBala](https://github.com/JakubBala), [@SamTaseff](https://github.com/2004seraph) and [@JuliusVanderArend](https://github.com/JuliusVanderArend)

### Dev notes
 - Do **NOT** update to the new input system or update the HDRP version, it will break the project.
 - This project uses Git LFS due to the monstrously big textures
